<h1 align="center">Welcome to Chat App 👋</h1>

> Chat App is a messaging app built with Flutter and Node.js using Socket.io and Express.js. It is available as a website deployed on Heroku, but can also be ran as a mobile app. Available at [https://ibkchatapp.herokuapp.com/](https://ibkchatapp.herokuapp.com/#/). I also wrote a [Medium article](https://iberatkaya.medium.com/developing-a-chat-app-with-express-socket-io-and-flutter-web-47dcaeb67768) about this app.
